# Portfolio page

This project started with the realisation that I had no real portfolio to speak of, and, as I was finishing up a course in React.js at codecademy.com, I thought I might as well challenge myself, andbuild it myself from the ground up, as opposed to using programs such as Figma or Squarespace.

## Technologies used

The web-app is built using React.js, as well as Tailwind CSS for styling.
