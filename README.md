# Portfolio page

This project started with the realisation that I had no real portfolio to speak of, and, as I was finishing up a course in React.js at codecademy.com, I thought I might as well challenge myself and build it myself from the ground up, as opposed to using programs such as Figma or Squarespace. I've focused on responsive and robust design to make the app look nice on any device, as well as exploring the capabilities of Tailwind as a tool for styling.

## Technologies

The web-app is built using React.js, as well as Tailwind CSS for styling.
